## FAQ

**How can I extend the duration of the weather notification?**  
In the `config.lua` file, you can change the `Config.NotificationDuration` setting to your desired number of milliseconds.  
For example, for a display lasting 30 seconds:

```lua
Config.NotificationDuration = 30000  -- 30 seconds (30000 ms)
```
